# Admin Manual

This manual covers installation and configuration of Teleport and the ongoing 
management of a Teleport cluster. It assumes that the reader has good understanding 
of Linux administration.

!!! danger "IMPORTANT": 
    At this time Teleport is NOT recommended for production use, but the code is open and 
    available for your security team to inspect. Currently Teleport is undergoing an independent 
    security review. We will be more comfortable recommending it for production use once the 
    review will have completed.
    
## Installation

### Installing from Source

Gravitational Teleport is written in Go language. It requires Golang v1.5 or newer. 
If you have Go already installed, type:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport 
> cd teleport
> make 
```

If you do not have Go but you have Docker installed and running, you can build Teleport
this way:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport
> cd teleport/build.assets
> make
```

### Installing from Binaries

You can download binaries from [Github releases](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases). 

## Running

Teleport supports only a handful of commands

|Command     | Description
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------
|start       | Starts the Teleport daemon.
|configure   | Dumps a sample configuration file in YAML format into standard output.
|version     | Shows the Teleport version.
|status      | Shows the status of a Teleport connection. This command is only available from inside of an active SSH seession.
|help        | Shows help.

When experimenting you can quickly start `teleport` with verbose logging by typing 
`teleport start -d`. 

When running `teleport` with a proxy role you have to make sure the assets
for the Web UI can be found. The web assets are composedof `index.html` file and `app` 
directory. Teleport process checks the following locations for its web assets:

   1. The same directory it's in
   2. `/usr/local/share/teleport`
   3. `/usr/share/teleport`
   4. `/opt/teleport`

!!! tip "IMPORTANT": 
    Teleport stores data in `/var/lib/teleport`. Make sure that regular users do not 
    have access to this folder of the Auth server, otherwise anyone can gain admin access to Teleport's API.

#### Systemd Unit File

In production, we recommend starting teleport daemon via an 
init system like `systemd`.  Here's the example of a systemd unit file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Teleport SSH Service
After=network.target 

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/teleport --config=/etc/teleport.yaml start

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Ports

Teleport services listen on several ports. This table shows the default port numbers.

|Port      | Service    | Description
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------
|3022      | Node       | SSH port. This is Teleport's equivalent of port `#22` for SSH.
|3023      | Proxy      | SSH port clients connect to. A proxy will forward this connection to port `#3022` on the destination node.
|3024      | Auth       | SSH port used by the Auth Service to serve its API to other nodes in a cluster.
|3080      | Proxy      | HTTPS connection to authenticate `tsh` users and web users into the cluster. The same connection is used to serve a Web UI.


## Configuration

You should use a configuration file to configure the `teleport` daemon. 
But for simpler experimentation you can use command line flags to 
`teleport start` command. To see the list of flags:

```
> teleport start --help
```

Output:

```
usage: teleport start [<flags>]
Flags:
  -d, --debug         Enable verbose logging to stderr
  -r, --roles         Comma-separated list of roles to start with [proxy,node,auth]
      --advertise-ip  IP to advertise to clients if running behind NAT
  -l, --listen-ip     IP address to bind to [0.0.0.0]
      --auth-server   Address of the auth server [127.0.0.1:3025]
      --token         One-time token to register with an auth server [none]
      --nodename      Name of this node, defaults to hostname
  -c, --config        Path to a configuration file [/etc/teleport.yaml]
      --labels        List of labels for this node
```

### Configuration Flags

Lets cover some of these flags in more detail:

* `--roles` flag tells Teleport which services to start. It is a comma-separated
  list of roles. The possible values are `auth`, `node` and `proxy`. The default 
  value is `auth,node,proxy`. These roles are explained in the 
  [Teleport Architecture](architecture.md) document.

* `--advertise-ip` flag can be used when Teleport nodes are running behind NAT and
  their externally routable IP cannot be automatically determined.

* `--nodename` flag lets you assign an alternative name the node which can be used
  by clients to login. By default it's equal to the value returned by `hostname` 
  command.

* `--listen-ip` shoud be used to tell `teleport` daemon to bind to a specific network
  interface. By default it listens on all.

* `--labels` flag allows to assign a set of labels to a node. See the explanation
  of labeling mechanism in "Labeling Nodes" section below.
  
### Configuration File

Teleport uses YAML file format for configuration. A sample configuration file is shown
below. By default it is stored in `/etc/teleport.yaml`

!!! note "IMPORTANT": 
    When editing YAML configuration, please pay attention to how your editor 
    handles white space. YAML requires consistent handling of tab characters.

```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows to assign an alternative name this node can be reached by.
    # by default it's equal to hostname
    nodename: graviton

    # one-time invitation token used to join a cluster. it is not used on 
    # subsequent starts
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # list of auth servers in a cluster. you will have more than one auth server
    # if you configure teleport auth to run in HA configuration

```

## Adding and Deleting Users

A user identity in Teleport exists in the scope of a cluster. The member nodes
of a cluster have multiple OS users on them. A Teleport administrator assigns
allowed logins to every Teleport account, allowing it to login as one of the 
specified OS users.

Lets look at this table:

|Teleport Username | Allowed Logins | Description
|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------
|joe    | joe,root | Teleport user 'joe' can login into member nodes as OS user 'joe' or 'root'
|bob    | bob      | Teleport user 'bob' can login into member nodes only as OS user 'bob'
|ross   |          | If no login is specified, it defaults to the same name as the Teleport user.

To add a new user to Teleport you have to use `tctl` tool on the same node where
the auth server is running, i.e. `teleport` was started with `--roles=auth`. 

```bash
> tctl users add joe joe,root
```

Teleport generates an auto-expiring token (with a TTL of 1 hour) and prints the token 
URL which must be shared with a user beforeo the TTL expires. 

```
Signup token has been created. Share this URL with the user:
https://<proxy>:3080/web/newuser/xxxxxxxxxxxx

NOTE: make sure the <proxy> host is accessible.
```

The user will complete registration by visiting this URL, picking a password and 
configuring the 2nd factor authentication. If the credentials are correct, the auth 
server generates and signs a new certificate and the client stores this key and will use 
it for subsequent logins. The key will automatically expire after 12 hours by default after which 
the user will need to log back in with her credentials. This TTL can be configured to a maximum
of 30 hours and a minimum of 1 minute. Once authenticated, the account will become visible via `tctl`:

```bash
> tctl users ls

User           Allowed to Login as
----           -------------------
admin          admin,root
ross           ross
joe            joe,root 
```

Joe would need to use the `tsh` client tool to login into member node "luna" via 
bastion "work" _as root_:

```bash
> tsh --proxy=work --user=joe root@luna
```

To delete this user:

```bash
> tctl users del joe
```

## Controlling access

At the moment `teleport` does not have a command for modifying an existing user record.
The only way to update allowed logins or reset the user password is to remove the account
and re-create it. 

The user will have to re-initialize Google Authenticator on their phone.

## Adding nodes to the cluster

Gravitational Teleport is a cluster SSH manager. It only allows SSH access to nodes
who had been previously granted cluster membership.

Use `tctl` tool to "invite" a new node to the Teleport cluster:

```bash
tctl nodes add
```

Just like with adding users above, Teleport generates a single-use auto-expiring token
with a TTL of 15 minutes and prints the following:

```
The invite token: n7305ee47a3829e118a7466ac7a0d78ad
Run this on the new node to join the cluster:
> teleport start --roles=node --token=n7305ee47a3829e118a7466ac7a0d78ad --auth-server=<Address>
```

`tctl` shows you the exact command you would need to use on the
new member node to start a `teleport` node service on it.

When a new node comes online, it will start sending ping requests every few seconds
to the auth server. This allows everyone to see which nodes are up:

```bash
> tctl nodes ls

Node Name     Node ID                                  Address            Labels
---------     -------                                  -------            ------
turing        d52527f9-b260-41d0-bb5a-e23b0cfe0f8f     10.1.0.5:3022      distro:ubuntu
dijkstra      c9s93fd9-3333-91d3-9999-c9s93fd98f43     10.1.0.6:3022      distro:debian
```

### Labeling Nodes

In addition to specifying a custom nodename, Teleport also allows to apply arbitrary
key:value pairs to each node. They are called labels. There are two kinds of labels:

1. `static labels` never change while the `teleport` process is running. You may want
   to label nodes with their physical location, the Linux distribution, etc.

2. `label commands` or "dynamic labels". Label commands allow you to execute an external
   command on a node at a configurable frequency. The output of that command becomes
   the value of such label. Examples include reporting a kernel version, load averages,
   time after reboot, etc.

Labels can be configured in a configuration file or via `--labels` flag as shown below:

```bash
> teleport start --labels uptime=[1m:"uptime -p"],kernel=[1h:"uname -r"]
```

Obvioiusly the kernel version is not going to change often, so this example runs
`uname` once an hour. When this node starts and reports its labels into the cluster,
users will see:

```bash
> tctl nodes ls

Node Name     Node ID          Address         Labels
---------     -------          -------         ------
turing        d52527f9-b260    10.1.0.5:3022   kernel=3.19.0-56,uptime=up 1 hour, 15 minutes
```

## Using Teleport with OpenSSH

Teleport is a fully standards-compliant SSH proxy and it can work in environments with 
existing SSH implementations, such as OpenSSH. This section will cover:

* Configuring OpenSSH client `ssh` to login into nodes inside a Teleport cluster.
* Configuring OpenSSH server `sshd` to join a Teleport cluster.

### Using OpenSSH Client

It is possible to use OpenSSH client `ssh` to connect to Teleport clusters. A Teleport
proxy works by using the standard SSH proxy subsystem. This section will explain how
to configure OpenSSH client to use it.

First, you need to export the public keys of cluster members. This has to be done 
on a node which runs Teleport auth server and probably must be done by a Teleport 
administrator:

```bash
> tctl authorities --type=host export > cluster_node_keys
```

On your client machine, you need to import these keys: 

```bash
> cat cluster_node_keys >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Configure OpenSSH client to use the Teleport proxy when connecting to nodes with matching
names. Edit `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`:

```
# Tell OpenSSH client to use work.example.com as a jumphost (proxy) when logging
# to any remote node whose name matches the pattern *.work.example.com
# Beware of recurison here (when proxy name matches your pattern)
Host *.work.example.com
  ProxyCommand ssh -p 3023 %r@work.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p
```

Launch `tsh` in the SSH agent mode:

```bash
> tsh --proxy=work.example.com agent
```

`tsh agent` will print environment variables into the console. Configure your system
to evaluate these variables: they tell `ssh` to use `tsh` to authenticate you against
`work.example.com` cluster.

When everything is configured properly, you can use ssh to connect to any node 
behind `work.example.com`:

```bash
> ssh root@database.work.example.com
```

### Integrating with OpenSSH Servers

Existing `sshd` servers can be added to a Teleport cluster. 

1. First, you have to export the CA certificate into a file:

```bash
> tctl authorities --type=user export > cluster-ca.pub
```

2. Then you should copy this file to every node running `sshd`, for example 
   `into /etc/ssh/teleport-ca.pub`

3. Update `sshd` configuration, usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/user-ca.pub
```

### Integrating with Ansible

Ansible is using OpenSSH client by default, this makes it compatible with Teleport without any extra work except
configuring OpenSSH client to work with Teleport Proxy:

* config your OpenSSH to connect to Teleport proxy and user `tsh agent` socket
* enable scp mode in the Ansible config file (default is `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`):
 
```bash
scp_if_ssh = True
```

## High Availability and Clustering
 
Teleport uses etcd backend to achieve highly available deployments. 

* Install etcd and configure peer and client TLS authentication using
   [etcd security guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/security.md).

      **Security note:** Only Auth servers should have client certificates allowing etcd access,
      otherwise anyone can write and overwrite keys in the backend!

* Set up Auth server to use etcd in `storage` section of Auth server's config file:

```
teleport:
    storage:
        type: etcd
        # still need data dir for local storage purposes
        data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
        # list of etcd peers to connect to
        peers:
        - https://172.17.0.1:4001
        # required path to TLS client certificate file to connect to etcd
        tls_cert_file: /var/lib/teleport/etcd-cert.pem
        # required path to TLS private key file to connect to etc
        tls_key_file: /var/lib/teleport/etcd-key.pem
        # optioinal file with trusted CA authority
        # file to authenticate etcd nodes
        tls_ca_file: /var/lib/teleport/etcd-ca.pem
```

* Deploy several Auth servers connected to etcd backend
* Deploy several Proxy nodes that have `auth_servers` pointed to list of Auth servers to connect

**NOTE** As new Auth servers will be added to the cluster and old servers will be decommisioned,
node's and proxies will refresh the list of available auth servers refresh the cluster info and
store the updated list locally in `/var/lib/teleport/authservers.json`. The values from this
file, if present, will take precendence over configuration file's values.
You can simply remove the file so that the configuration file's values can take effect again.

## Troubleshooting

To diagnose problems you can configure `teleport` to run with verbose logging enabled.

!!! warning "IMPORTANT": 
    It is not recommended to run Teleport in production with verbose logging
    as it generates substantial amount of data.

Sometimes you may want to reset `teleport` to a clean state. This can be accomplished
by erasing everything under `"data_dir"` directory. Assuming the default location, 
`rm -rf /var/lib/teleport/*` will do.
